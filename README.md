# JavaScriptES6

EcmaScript 6.
#Arrow functions, enchanced collections, generators, etc
code feels clean, intuitive and well designed.(Bt problem with web).

#Babel and Webpack help create an ES6 Development environment.

#Why Babel and transpilers.?
#transpilers:
  - Browsers only have widespread support of older JS.
  - Transpilers Convert advanced TypScript and CoffeeScript code back into the original JS.

  Eg. Babel:(babeljs.io)

#Webpack
 - It bundles modules into .js file
 - comes with a dev-server

 #Start work with Webpack:
  - npm init -y
  - npm install --save-dev webpack
